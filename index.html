                    Hello and welcome to my website! My name is Macy and I grew up in a small town in the north Georgia called Ellijay.
                    Later, I moved to Atlanta and spent 5 years at Georgia Tech. In 2015, I graduated from the School
                    of Industrial Design at Georgia Institute of Technology. I am passionate about design and how it
                    improves human interaction with technology.  I enjoyed reading Don Norman's <i>The Design of Everyday Things</i> because he explains
                    the interaction between people and objects. He describes the different failures of design and how 
                    user experience designers solve design problems to improve user interaction with a product. My goal is to be a user experience and 
                    user interface designer so that I can solve the problems that users encounter.
                </p>

                    In my spare time I improve my programming skills by working on Arduino and Blynk projects. One of my favorite projects
                    was the concept of an interactive piano that taught the user to read sheet music. Also, I
                    enjoy outdoor activities such as hiking, birding, and doing nature photography. When birding, the species and
                    count are entered in Ebird. The Ebird application is a compilation of birder identifications sent to Cornell for research.
